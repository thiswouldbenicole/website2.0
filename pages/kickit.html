			<h1>Kick.it</h1>
			<h2>UX Design</h2>
			<h3>December 2013</h3>
			<p>Kick.it is a small startup building a mobile application that makes it fast and easy to plan informal events with friends. I started my work for Kick.it after a few months of its existance, to assist in a re-design of the product. I worked mostly on visual design.</p>

					<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
					<p>When I joined the project, the product only allowed users to invite their friends to events privately. However, user feedback made it clear that users would like the ability to create events open to all their friends. </p>
					<p>We created user scenarios to aid in designing the feature. For example, a user might want to get lunch with friends, but has no idea who is free. This user would create an "open invite" for lunch that all of his friends could see and join. Based off this user scenario, I worked with the team's engineers on wireframes to figure how this feature could be intergrated with the existing product.</p>

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>The Kick.it team requested a purple, flat theme.</p>
					<p>Join/Decline buttons are all lined up on the right side, to make it easy for users accept or decline invites, even if the user has many invites to scroll through. A row of pictures of who is attending is included right after the event info in the list. Having the information available without having to click through for more information will help some users move through accepting/declining events faster, as some users expressed seeing who was attending would help them make their decision. </p>
