			<p>Achieve, (formerly know as 'Pact') is a goal-tracking platform that was developed as a research project under Professor Cosley. Our project was accepted to CHI 2014 as a work in progress.</p>

					<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
					<h3>Concept Ideation</h3>
					<p>Building upon previous studies conducted at Cornell, our research group wanted to explore the effects of social media on how people achieve goals. To do this, we decided to develop our own goal tracking platform, Achieve, from scratch. We sent out surveys to college students, our target audience, which lead us to realized that students would feel more motivated to achieve their goals if they completed their goals in groups. A study by Burke and Settles showed that groups that consist of already existing relationships inspires higher performance, so we decided to create a platform focused on accomplishing goals with pre-existing friend groups.</p>
					<p>Below are pictures from some of our brainstorming sessions: </p>

The middle image is the 'Group Progress' view with gives users a more visual way to check their group's progress. Clicking a on a user's profile picture or name brings a user to the right page, the 'Indvidual Progress' page. This page documents one user's progress for the goal in question.</p></li>

All of the users goals are listed on the top, to constantly remind them what they are working toward. Users have the ability to check in from the home screen, making it quick and easy to log their progress.</p></li>

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>Green was chosen as the accent color of the app because green is generally associated with success. To help enforce a social feel, profile pictures of users are shown, and activity is shown as speech bubbles. The “add comment” box is available under every single post to make it clear to users that commenting is encouraged. Users also have the option to like their friends progress, so they can quickly and easily give their friends positive feedback.</p>
