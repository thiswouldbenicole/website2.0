			<h1>RosieApp</h1>
			<h2>UX Designer</h2>
			<h3>October 2012 - January 2013</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.rosieapp.com/">RosieApp</a> is a Cornell based startup creating a platform that allows users to shop online for groceries at local stores, and will eventually act as a predictive shopping platform that will order things for you before running out.</p>
			<p>I actually joined RosieApp intending to work on mobile development. However, I ended up completing a lot of design work.</p>

					<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
					<p>When I first joined the team, I was asked to make mockups based on wireframes and a visual style the team had already determined before I joined. Below is the result.</p>

					<p>Users would click on a product, and then click on a milk jug to indicate how much of the product they thought they had left. This system got the job done but quite frankly, I took me a while to understand how it worked. Interfaces should be self-explanatory, and should not have to be learned, so I started to work on a new system proposal. </p>

					<p>I thought an in-line system would make it clearer that a user needed to input quantities left, through the milk jugs, for each product. Milk jugs icons on the left would show how much of the item the app thought the user had left. Users could hold down those individual milk jugs to pull up a small popup menu to change the values per item. However, the milk jug representations were still quick confusing. I showed this mockup to other people, and many were confused about the purpose of the milk jug.</p>

					<p>This next system is both visually functional, and simple to use; The colored background of each list item would represent how much of the item the app thought the user had left. Colors and fullness of the bars made it much more clear which items they were running out of. By pressing and holding on the colored bar of a list, users could slide the bars to indicate how much they thought they had left, making it much easier to input information.</p>

					<p>Red signifies that a user is about to run out of the product. Yellow signifies that a user is running low of the product. Green signifies there is plenty of the product left. I choose the colors based on preset conventions of battery indicators. Smartphone users are generally familiar with this convention, and this application was a smartphone application, so the meaning would hopefully be apparent to users.</p>

					<h2>Branding</h2>
					<p>It was important to the team that RosieApp felt more like your personal shopper, and less like another grocery shopping app. As a result it was important to personify Rosie in the company branding.</p>
