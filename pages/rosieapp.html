			<h2>UX Designer</h2>
			<h3>October 2012 - January 2013</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.rosieapp.com/">RosieApp</a> is a Cornell based startup creating platform that allows users to shop online for groceries at local stores, and will eventually act as a predictive shopping platform that will order things for you before running out.</p>
			<p>I actually joined RosieApp intending to work on mobile development. However, I ended up completing a lot of design work.</p>

					<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
					<p>When I first joined the team, I was asked to make mockups based on wireframes the team had produced before I joined. Below is the result.</p>

					<p>Users would click on a milk jug reprsenting how much they thought they had left, and then would have to select items...  This system got the job done but quite frankly, I took me a while to understand how it worked. Interfaces should be easy and self explanitory. They should not have to be learned, so I started to work on a new system proposal. </p>

					<p>I thought an in-line system would make it more clear that the milk jugs representing the amount  Milk jugs icons on the left would show how much of the item the app thought the user had left. Users could hold down those idividual milk jugs to pull up a small popup menu to change the values per item, if the user wanted to change the amount of a product. However, the system's popup menus could be confusing... </p>

					<p>I developed this new system to be both visually fuctional, and simple to use: The colored background bars of each list item would represent how much of the item the app thought the user had left. Colors and fullness of the bars made it much more clear which items were running out. By pressing and holding on a list item, users could slide the colored bars to indicate how much they thought they had left, making it much easier way to input information.

					<h2>Visual Design</h2>
					<p>Below is a mockup of the app, reflected the new official branding.</p>
					<p>Red signifies about to run out. Yellow signifies running low. Green signifies there is plenty of the product left. I choose the colors based on preset conventions of battery indicators.</p>
